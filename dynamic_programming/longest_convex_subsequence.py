# Problem:

# A sequence X[1..m] of integers is said to be convex
# if X[i+1] - X[i] > X[i] - X[i-1] for every integer i between 2 and m-1.
# Thus, the sequence [0, 1, 3, 7, 12, 20] is convex, and so is [5, 3, 2, 2, 4, 8].
# On the other hand, [0, 3, 7, 8, 13] is not convex because 8 - 7 < 7 - 3.
# Note that a sequence with 0, 1, or 2 integers is convex by definition.
# Here is another way of thinking about convex sequences.
# Given X[1..m], define Y[2..m] by letting Y[i] = X[i] - X[i-1].
# Thus, Y is the sequence consisting of differences between successive terms of X.
# The sequence X is convex if and only if the sequence Y is increasing.
# The name convex comes from the fact that is we plot the points (i, X[i]) in the plane, one gets a convex shape.
# The algorithmic problem we wish to solve is this. We are given as input a sequence A[1..n] of non-negative integers,
# and we wish to find a longest convex subsequence of A.
# For example, if A = [0, 3, 7, 8, 13], then a longest convex subsequence is [0, 3, 7, 13].

# Solution:
# Running time of following solution is O (n^3)
